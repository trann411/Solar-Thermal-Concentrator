This past week:
Coded 'Main' script in MatLab that calls functions and interacts between Microcontroller and Interface.
Main is able to pull data from an external source and display basic Solar positioning data within the MatLab M-file. 
Interface now has basic graphs for solar positioning data and has linked components (switches and indicators)

This next week:
Physically start constructing shudder systems and integrate actuators. 
Hard code Astronomical Algorithms into function for local data calculations; will use other excel file for validation and error calculations. 
Connect interface and back end to actually communicate; Interface should control and initialize back end.
Research advanced focal device designs for spring semester (Research paper for Optics)
