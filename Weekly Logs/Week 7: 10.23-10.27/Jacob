Past Week:
- Finished azimuth control loop (running off of input from magnetometer)

- Presented Status Update Presentation 

- Wrote Accelrometer Interface & Tilt Angle Calculation Code
- - Speced out additonal parts to facilitate sponsor's desired sensor configuration.

- Wrote Shutter Actuator Interface Code & Tested with Shutter Actuator
- - Higher duty cycle needed than expected (40% vs 20%).

- Worked with Tran to develop microcontroller-sensor interconnect board (PCB)
- - Drew up preliminary schematics

Next Week:
- Interface with azinmuth rotary encoder & splice into azimuth control loop
- Begin creating tilt control loop & (if parts arrive) perform functional tests
