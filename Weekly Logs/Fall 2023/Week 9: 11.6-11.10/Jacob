Last Week:
- Sourced parts for mounting rotary encoder to concentrator
- Integrated additional accelerometers, accelerometer mux, & I2C active terminator into system
- Began assembly of power distribution PCB
- Investigated methods for 3D calibration of magnetometer

Next Week:
- Mount rotary encoder
- Create magnetometer calibration function
- Once here, begin assembly of microcontroller interconnect PCB & accelerometer array PCB
