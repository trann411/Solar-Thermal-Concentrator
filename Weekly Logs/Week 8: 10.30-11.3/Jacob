Last Week:
- Experimentally valided minimum PWM duty cycle for azimuth motor, tilt actuator, 
  and shutter actuators (25%, 20%, & 40%, respectively)
- Began creating post-processing algorithm for tilt angle accelerometer array based on paper provided by sponsor.
- Created rotary encoder angle change logic; began integrating into azimuth control loop.
- Conducted general code cleanup, reorganizaiton, and commenting for transparency.

Next Week:
- Physically mount azimuth rotary encoder to rig.
- Control working on azimuth control and tilt control code.
